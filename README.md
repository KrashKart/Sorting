# Sorting
A compilation of actual and trolling sorting algorithms written in Python. Made for fun.

## Why Python?
Because I love Python and am too lazy to think in C++ or Java

## Sorts
All currently implemented sorting algorithms are listed below:
- Simple
    - Bubble Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Selection Sort
- Data Structs (for more complex sorting algorithms)
    - Binary Tree Sort
- Trolling
    - Bogo Sort
    - Sleep Sort
    - Stalin Sort
    - Miracle Sort
    - Gaslight Sort

## Planned Additions
The planned additions to the sorting catalogue are as below:
- Proper
    - Quick Sort
    - Heap Sort
    - Binary Tree Sort
- Trolling
    - Bozo Sort
    - Slow Sort
    - Quantum Bogo Sort

## Utils
A few utility files have been made to assist with the testing of these sorts:
- `sample_lists.py`: Contains code to randomly generate lists of certain lengths
- `verify.py`: Contains helper function to validate if a list is sorted
- `wrappers.py`: Contains wrapper functions to time and print *before* and *after* arrays, as well as the number of comparisons and swaps
